VkFlags
  category:bitmasks without flags enum are UInt32 now, might be helper translating class (like alias) [TODO]

Bool32
  now we use this helper struct to convert between Vulkan's 32bit boolean type and .NET bool
  we might replace it with bool and do the marshalling when calling vulkan functions. not sure yet what will be better. [for discussion]

platform specific API is in extensions
  now we only disable these when generating structures. we should handle it better by using the <extension> elements [TODO]
